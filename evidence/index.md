# Evidence index

This file tracks the status of every significant verification claim made
about CareFund. Each entry states the claim, the evidence backing it, the
date it was checked, and its status using one of:

`VERIFIED` (real, externally checkable evidence exists), `TESTED LOCALLY`
(a real automated test ran on this machine, not against a fully live
external system), `LOGICALLY COVERED` (the code path is unit tested or
type checked but not exercised end to end), `UNVERIFIED` (not yet
checked), `KNOWN LIMITATION` (a real, permanent gap), `BLOCKED` (checked,
and something outside this session's control prevents verification).
